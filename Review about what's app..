Whats app is now just being an app that seems to be less successful unlike the other apps in future  ....
It needs to be changed in function features and style ....
Whats not just an app but is now becoming disappointment to  users  its features like  money transfer is a good
Idea for industry but not going to affect its much worth as  people are more comfortable and  feel free in using other banking apps but feel a little hesitate while ok WhatsApp....
Whats app do something interesting .....
Its just an openion ....
